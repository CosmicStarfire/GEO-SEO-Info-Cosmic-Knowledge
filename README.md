# GEO-SEO-Info-Cosmic-Knowledge
A visual learning space to explore SEO vs GEO, inspect the code, and see how AI reads structured HTML.

# 🌌 Teach-Through-Inspect — GEO Training Playground

An interactive learning environment to explore **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** through real code inspection.  
This repository demonstrates how structured data can be embedded into an HTML document in a way that is readable to both **humans** and **AI systems** such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

> 🚀 The goal: Teach GEO by letting people *inspect it, toggle it, and understand it visually.*

## 📚 What learners will understand

### By the end of this session, developers will be able to:

- Explain the difference between **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**  
  and **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**  
- Identify where structured data lives inside a webpage  
- View machine-readable schema through inspect tools  
- Embed their own ld+json GEO blocks into code  
- Build webpages designed for **AI indexing, not just Google ranking**

## 🧠 Why this matters

Traditional SEO was built for search engines.  
GEO is built for **LLMs — tools that read, store, summarize & answer.**
